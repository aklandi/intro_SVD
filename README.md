# An Introduction to Singular Value Decomposition

In the Python notebook *svd.ipynb*, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used in three applications: image compression, de-noising an image, and linear regression.  This demo notebook is appropriate for undergraduate students who just learned SVD.  While image compression and de-noising use reduced-rank SVD, the linear regression application currently uses full-rank SVD.
